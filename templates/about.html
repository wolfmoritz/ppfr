                <p> Hi there! I’m Peri and I live in London, United Kingdom with my husband Wolf. We moved north from Seattle, Washington so that Wolf could continue his career as part of this coffee thing, you may have heard of it? If not, go out and read Moby Dick, there is a clue somewhere in there.</p>

                <p>As for me, between trying to keep the two of us healthy and obsessing with the local history it seems the days fly by. We've been making the most of our time here in England. </p>
              
                
                <!-- <p> This blog is a place that will allow me to combine two of my loves, movies and cooking. Hopefully I’ll be able to create some fun videos that will document some of the things that I enjoy making in the kitchen. I doubt it will be a Julie or Julia kinda thing, but who knows.</p> -->
                <p>Check out my most popular recipe, the Scotchmallow. I really need to come up with a different name, but for now that's what I got. Inspired by the classic See's candy it has become a required holiday candy that must be made. I'm ok with that as I enjoy making holiday treats.</p>
